                                        6 months up to 4 years.

                                        This temporary visa allows the overseas candidate to potentially seek permanent
                                        residence after completing a minimum period of Australian work experience either
                                        with the sponsorship of the Australian employer or possibly even via skilled
                                        migration.

                                        To qualify to apply for the visa, the Australian company must first obtain
                                        sponsorship and nomination approval.

                                        entry into Australia. It is not the only option for skilled workers but it is
                                        the most desirable due to the independence and opportunity for permanent
                                        residence.

                                        To qualify for this Skilled Independent Visa, an applicant must meet the basic
                                        requirements. Most commonly these applicants will be working in occupations that
                                        appear on the Essential Skills List.

                                        This is the most desirable of all skilled visas. It allows the successful
                                        applicant, independent of a sponsor, to gain permanent residency in Australia,
                                        and places no restriction on the region of residence or the nature of the work
                                        the applicant can undertake.

                                        In addition, the successful applicant must pass an English Test (proving their
                                        ability to read, write and understand English).

                                        Permanent residents can work for any employer in any occupation. But, working in
                                        the Public Service or Armed forces is strictly restricted to the Australian

                                        permanent residents and citizens. Permanent residents enjoy the same benefits
                                        under these laws as the citizens. They can become a part of trade unions and can
